<h2>Our Development Process</h2>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>For more than a year now over 170 contributors, including our growing core team, have given their free time to create complex systems integrations and realistic features entirely from scratch. Our core principle is to maintain professional standards and adhere to industry-wide best practices delivering high-quality, rigorously-tested products. We always strive to simulate a working feature to the maximum extent possible. Unlike most other addons you can take a deep dive into our code on GitHub and see for yourself - and maybe stick around, help us out, or even start your own project!</p>
<p>Once on our GitHub you can see our code base and more importantly our "pull requests" which are essentially features, fixes, or changes to the A32NX. Before any feature is ever available to the public we ensure it follows this general process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has documentation and is available on the IRL A320neo</li>
<li>Code review</li>
<li>Pilot or engineer feedback (if applicable)</li>
<li>Rounds of QA testing to identify issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>Parallel Development</h3>
<p>We often see questions on why we release updates or progress on certain features instead of a feature that many of you are excited about.</p>
<p>Everyone at FlyByWire Simulations is a volunteer. With parallel development, we can have different people working on various features simultaneously. Simply put, we can have someone who is great at working with lights or sounds complete their work ahead of the people working hard on systems such as LNAV/VNAV. When it comes to developing such a complex aircraft parallel development comes naturally, leading to accelerated development and the inclusion of many new features.</p>
<h3>Quality Assurance Teams</h3>
<p>While possibly unknown to some of our user base we actually have a team of dedicated QA testers also working in their free time to test every feature before they are released to the public on our Stable or Development branches. We are immeasurably grateful to these people for giving their time to following our testing instructions and providing feedback to our developers.</p>
<p>If you'd like to know more about our QA process we have a handy guide on our documentation site. Who knows, you may even be interested in joining our QA ranks.</p>

<h2>Development Updates</h2>
<h3>Improved Autopilot Speed/Mach Mode</h3>
<p>The new Speed/Mach law on the experimental and development versions introduces improved pitching behaviour, more realistic flight characteristics in turbulent weather as well as smoother speed and altitude changes during climb and descent through more accurate energy angle estimation.</p>
<p>In Open Climb Mode (OP CLB on the FMA) or Open Descend Mode (OP DES on the FMA), the A320neo performs energy angle control. Energy angle describes the distribution between kinetic and potential energy. The plane’s energy is distributed such that the ratio between kinetic energy and potential energy remains constant during speed changes in climb or descent. During climb, the aircraft uses its total energy both for climbing and acceleration or deceleration. During descent, the aircraft would continue to descend while decelerating at the same time. In the following video, you can take a closer look at the behaviour.</p>

<h3>EFIS Filters and FIX INFO</h3>
<p>Our custom ND now features EFIS filters, bringing it ever closer to its real-life counterpart. Included is a proper word transmission limit implementation, causing the ND to display a <code>MAP PARTLY DISPLAYED</code> message when the amount of data being transmitted and displayed has reached the limit. Furthermore, it can now draw runway symbols following technical specifications.</p>
<p>We have also added the FIX INFO feature, a long-awaited functionality which allows users to input fix radials or radii on the LAT REV page of the MCDU flight plan display and displays the appropriate markers for those elements on the ND.</p>
<p>Sample FIX INFO image showcasing a 33NM radius ring from CROWY providing a visual aid to assist with TOD planning from FL370 to FL260.

<h3>TCAS</h3>
<p>Another anticipated feature is TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System). We aim to implement TCAS 7.1, a first among all Airbus simulation addons. This includes a new TA/RA voice and other features.</p>
<p>Our implementation will eventually also include AUTO TCAS - allowing the plane's autopilot to obey resolution advisories for the pilot if no intervention happens, through a new TCAS vertical mode. However, we are not quite ready to show this off yet, as it requires a new law in our autopilot model. More news on that soon!</p>
<h3>ARINC 429</h3>
<p>We often talk about going to great lengths to bring realism to the A32NX. This does not just apply to surface-level details - making a high-fidelity aircraft requires simulating details that are not documented in pilot training references.</p>
<p>Part of this is the initial version of our ARINC 429 implementation on the development version. For those unaware, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429">ARINC 429</a> is a data transfer standard used in many airliners which takes care of identifying, transporting and delivering data from and to various systems in the aircraft. It also ties in deeply with failure states on the A32NX - indeed, a lot of the logic involved in displaying the unavailability of information or detecting equipment faults relies on this protocol showing the correct failure indications on data labels.</p>
<p>The A32NX now comes with ARINC 429 communications between some of its systems. While this is not tied to any visible effects for now, it lays a solid foundation for the work to come on abnormal operations and accurate display symbology in failure states.</p>
<h3>New New Flight Plan Manager</h3>
<p>As you all know, we have introduced a new FMS in our experimental branch, which is partly based on the Working Title flight plan manager. While this brings a big improvement on its own, it's only the first step in achieving a system that has the same behaviour and systems design as the real deal. Our current version of the custom FMS does an additional layer of mapping to leg-form flight plans on top of the WT system, which works with waypoint-form flight plans. This is not how the real aircraft works, so we teamed up with <a href="https://synapticsim.com/">Synaptic Simulations</a> to develop a completely custom flight plan manager layer that works directly with leg-form flight plans.</p>
<p>This new system is already in use in the A380X previews we showed you earlier last month, so you can check out part of its capabilities here:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-AaNFihJAw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br></br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/roI7vTbCH1I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This code is going to be ported both to the A320 and A220 by Synaptic. It will eventually enable the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for all leg types (including holding patterns, intercepts).</li>
<li>Support for realistic DIR TO revisions (DF legs, W/ ABEAM, RADIAL IN/OUT).</li>
<li>Highly accurate flight path computation, using exclusive in-depth information and insight into the A320 FMS.</li>
</ul>
<h3>State of Hydraulics</h3>
<p>So, what’s up with hydraulics?</p>
<p>You may notice something new when opening the cargo door. It may seem like a simple animation update, but it certainly belies what is going on under the hood.</p>
<p>Remember how we showed that the door is now a free-moving body in a demo video of the A32NX flying with an open door? We have since added fully-simulated hydraulic actuators that can move the heavy door using hydraulic pressure.</p>
<h4>How is this done?</h4>
<p>First, we built the actuator according to real-life dimensions:</p>
<p><img src="/img/notam-images/sept/hydraulics-1.png" alt="hydraulic 1"></p>
<p>This enabled us to compute not only the exact relation between force and pressure, but also fluid reservoir variations between the extended and retracted positions due to internal volume asymmetry. In fact, when the gears are retracted in flight, you will see how much green hydraulic fluid is missing on the reservoir level indicator on the ECAM screen! Then, the actuator is connected to the free-moving body using real-life positions of the anchor point to the plane’s structure and control arm of the moving body.</p>
<p><img src="/img/notam-images/sept/hydraulics-2.png" alt="hydraulic 2"></p>
<p>Now that all the parts are connected, the fun begins! Pressure in the hydraulic system provides force and system pumps provide hydraulic flow. This intricate dance between pressure and flow gives you the power to move the control surfaces. That cargo door oscillation you saw in our previous NOTAM is not a hard-coded animation - it is the hydraulics coming to life, as fast pressure changes from the control valves opening cause flow oscillations in the system.</p>
<p>It does not end here. Soon, you will get to see the main gear oscillating when retracting… or use gravity extension to save the day!</p>
<h4>What’s next?</h4>
<p>We are overhauling the core hydraulic system, which will see separate hydraulic sections communicating with check valves. Of course, we will also be able to simulate the hydraulic systems of a certain 4-engine plane.</p>
<ul>
<li>Electric pumps will feature real-time electric current regulation, so we hope you will hear the difference. Oh, and we almost forgot: don’t burn the circuit breaker.</li>
<li>We will replace the current simple flow model of the Power Transfer Unit (PTU) with a physical model incorporating real-time physics that will replicate those well-known dog barks, as well as the crazy growling sounds of a slow constant PTU rotation during gear or flap extensions with limited pump capacities.</li>
<li>We will improve the current RAT model so that it provides hydraulic flow to a fully simulated emergency generator.</li>
<li>Finally, all control surfaces will eventually be connected to the system and exhibit true-to-life behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>In normal situations, you will not notice any difference. Here’s the exciting part, though: with all these little things simulated in the background, it is going to shine when it comes to failures. Watch this space.</p>
<h3>Exterior Lighting Overhaul</h3>
<p>We have improved the visual appearance of the lights, added correct behavior and fixed a few issues.</p>
<p>Working with lights in the MSFS SDK is very inconvenient due to legacy APIs, the lack of good tools, and poorly-implemented light physics. They do not bounce, cast shadows or even accept geometry as a blocker. They only allow an illuminated surface to reflect other geometry. This means that lights, and how they look, need to be handcrafted within SDK limits.</p>
<p><img src="/img/notam-images/sept/beacon.jpg" alt="beacon"></p>
<p>One example of this is the beacon lights, the red ones at the top and bottom of the fuselage - we used 14 individual lights in order to cast light realistically. For the landing lights, despite only consisting of two lights in real life, we had to use 11 individual lights to create a convincing effect.</p>
<p>Moreover, the strobe lights are now synced with the beacon light according to the real-life blinking pattern, whereas this was not the case before. In addition, the strobe lights are now visible from all wing views (including custom ones) and the cockpit.</p>
<p><img src="/img/notam-images/sept/lights-illustration.jpg" alt="lights-illustration">
<sub>Copyright © 2021 Collins Aerospace, UTC Aerospace Systems</sub></p>
<p>The landing lights extend or retract at the correct speed, will not light up until they are fully deployed and are now independent of each other. They are also angled correctly (slightly downwards) to illuminate the runway on approach and their range has increased.</p>
<p>Nav lights now project at the correct angles and can only be seen within those angles. This is how you determine the travel direction of an airplane at night. Watch out for one red and one green at the same time, you might be in trouble!</p>
<p>Even with all these changes, the A32NX lights will continue to be improved upon when the SDK is expanded and perhaps include proper raytracing, a DX12 feature.</p>

<h3>A380X</h3>
<p>We know you are all waiting patiently on our A380X release, and while we cannot give timelines at the moment, we are very satisfied with the progress being made.</p>
<p>We are aiming to release an aircraft with entirely custom systems, with no reliance whatsoever on a default FMC. You can expect a lot of the same accuracy we are developing in the A32NX to transfer over to the A380X, with of course a correct implementation for the unique characteristics of the largest passenger aircraft in the world.</p>
<p>This includes an entirely re-written FMS, with support for every possible path type, RNP procedures, FLS, RNAV and vertical predictions/guidance.</p>

Our core principle is to maintain professional standards and adhere to industry-wide best practices delivering high-quality, rigorously-tested products. We always strive to simulate a working feature to the maximum extent possible. Unlike most other addons you can take a deep dive into our code on GitHub and see for yourself - and maybe stick around, help us out, or even start your own project!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce on our GitHub you can see our code base and more importantly our \"pull requests\" which are essentially features, fixes, or changes to the A32NX. Before any feature is ever available to the public we ensure it follows this general process:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHas documentation and is available on the IRL A320neo\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCode review\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePilot or engineer feedback (if applicable)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRounds of QA testing to identify issues\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eParallel Development\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe often see questions on why we release updates or progress on certain features instead of a feature that many of you are excited about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone at FlyByWire Simulations is a volunteer. With parallel development, we can have different people working on various features simultaneously. Simply put, we can have someone who is great at working with lights or sounds complete their work ahead of the people working hard on systems such as LNAV/VNAV. When it comes to developing such a complex aircraft parallel development comes naturally, leading to accelerated development and the inclusion of many new features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eQuality Assurance Teams\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile possibly unknown to some of our user base we actually have a team of dedicated QA testers also working in their free time to test every feature before they are released to the public on our Stable or Development branches. We are immeasurably grateful to these people for giving their time to following our testing instructions and providing feedback to our developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you'd like to know more about our QA process we have a handy guide on our documentation site. Who knows, you may even be interested in joining our QA ranks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.flybywiresim.com/dev-corner/qa-process/\"\u003eQuality Assurance Documentation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDevelopment Updates\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eImproved Autopilot Speed/Mach Mode\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new Speed/Mach law on the experimental and development versions introduces improved pitching behaviour, more realistic flight characteristics in turbulent weather as well as smoother speed and altitude changes during climb and descent through more accurate energy angle estimation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Open Climb Mode (OP CLB on the FMA) or Open Descend Mode (OP DES on the FMA), the A320neo performs energy angle control. Energy angle describes the distribution between kinetic and potential energy. The plane’s energy is distributed such that the ratio between kinetic energy and potential energy remains constant during speed changes in climb or descent. During climb, the aircraft uses its total energy both for climbing and acceleration or deceleration. During descent, the aircraft would continue to descend while decelerating at the same time. In the following video, you can take a closer look at the behaviour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wydne11lydA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eEFIS Filters and FIX INFO\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur custom ND now features EFIS filters, bringing it ever closer to its real-life counterpart. Included is a proper word transmission limit implementation, causing the ND to display a \u003ccode\u003eMAP PARTLY DISPLAYED\u003c/code\u003e message when the amount of data being transmitted and displayed has reached the limit. Furthermore, it can now draw runway symbols following technical specifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have also added the FIX INFO feature, a long-awaited functionality which allows users to input fix radials or radii on the LAT REV page of the MCDU flight plan display and displays the appropriate markers for those elements on the ND.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSample FIX INFO image showcasing a 33NM radius ring from CROWY providing a visual aid to assist with TOD planning from FL370 to FL260.\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/fixinfo.jpg\" alt=\"fix info\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRead more - \u003ca href=\"https://docs.flybywiresim.com/fbw-a32nx/feature-guides/fixinfo/\"\u003eFix Info Feature Documentation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTCAS\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother anticipated feature is TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System). We aim to implement TCAS 7.1, a first among all Airbus simulation addons. This includes a new TA/RA voice and other features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur implementation will eventually also include AUTO TCAS - allowing the plane's autopilot to obey resolution advisories for the pilot if no intervention happens, through a new TCAS vertical mode. However, we are not quite ready to show this off yet, as it requires a new law in our autopilot model. More news on that soon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eARINC 429\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe often talk about going to great lengths to bring realism to the A32NX. This does not just apply to surface-level details - making a high-fidelity aircraft requires simulating details that are not documented in pilot training references.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of this is the initial version of our ARINC 429 implementation on the development version. For those unaware, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429\"\u003eARINC 429\u003c/a\u003e is a data transfer standard used in many airliners which takes care of identifying, transporting and delivering data from and to various systems in the aircraft. It also ties in deeply with failure states on the A32NX - indeed, a lot of the logic involved in displaying the unavailability of information or detecting equipment faults relies on this protocol showing the correct failure indications on data labels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe A32NX now comes with ARINC 429 communications between some of its systems. While this is not tied to any visible effects for now, it lays a solid foundation for the work to come on abnormal operations and accurate display symbology in failure states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNew New Flight Plan Manager\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you all know, we have introduced a new FMS in our experimental branch, which is partly based on the Working Title flight plan manager. While this brings a big improvement on its own, it's only the first step in achieving a system that has the same behaviour and systems design as the real deal. Our current version of the custom FMS does an additional layer of mapping to leg-form flight plans on top of the WT system, which works with waypoint-form flight plans. This is not how the real aircraft works, so we teamed up with \u003ca href=\"https://synapticsim.com/\"\u003eSynaptic Simulations\u003c/a\u003e to develop a completely custom flight plan manager layer that works directly with leg-form flight plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis new system is already in use in the A380X previews we showed you earlier last month, so you can check out part of its capabilities here:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-AaNFihJAw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/br\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/roI7vTbCH1I\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis code is going to be ported both to the A320 and A220 by Synaptic. It will eventually enable the following features:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSupport for all leg types (including holding patterns, intercepts).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSupport for realistic DIR TO revisions (DF legs, W/ ABEAM, RADIAL IN/OUT).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHighly accurate flight path computation, using exclusive in-depth information and insight into the A320 FMS.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eState of Hydraulics\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what’s up with hydraulics?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may notice something new when opening the cargo door. It may seem like a simple animation update, but it certainly belies what is going on under the hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember how we showed that the door is now a free-moving body in a demo video of the A32NX flying with an open door? We have since added fully-simulated hydraulic actuators that can move the heavy door using hydraulic pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHow is this done?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, we built the actuator according to real-life dimensions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/hydraulics-1.png\" alt=\"hydraulic 1\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis enabled us to compute not only the exact relation between force and pressure, but also fluid reservoir variations between the extended and retracted positions due to internal volume asymmetry. In fact, when the gears are retracted in flight, you will see how much green hydraulic fluid is missing on the reservoir level indicator on the ECAM screen! Then, the actuator is connected to the free-moving body using real-life positions of the anchor point to the plane’s structure and control arm of the moving body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/hydraulics-2.png\" alt=\"hydraulic 2\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that all the parts are connected, the fun begins! Pressure in the hydraulic system provides force and system pumps provide hydraulic flow. This intricate dance between pressure and flow gives you the power to move the control surfaces. That cargo door oscillation you saw in our previous NOTAM is not a hard-coded animation - it is the hydraulics coming to life, as fast pressure changes from the control valves opening cause flow oscillations in the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt does not end here. Soon, you will get to see the main gear oscillating when retracting… or use gravity extension to save the day!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat’s next?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are overhauling the core hydraulic system, which will see separate hydraulic sections communicating with check valves. Of course, we will also be able to simulate the hydraulic systems of a certain 4-engine plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eElectric pumps will feature real-time electric current regulation, so we hope you will hear the difference. Oh, and we almost forgot: don’t burn the circuit breaker.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe will replace the current simple flow model of the Power Transfer Unit (PTU) with a physical model incorporating real-time physics that will replicate those well-known dog barks, as well as the crazy growling sounds of a slow constant PTU rotation during gear or flap extensions with limited pump capacities.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe will improve the current RAT model so that it provides hydraulic flow to a fully simulated emergency generator.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFinally, all control surfaces will eventually be connected to the system and exhibit true-to-life behaviour.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn normal situations, you will not notice any difference. Here’s the exciting part, though: with all these little things simulated in the background, it is going to shine when it comes to failures. Watch this space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eExterior Lighting Overhaul\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have improved the visual appearance of the lights, added correct behavior and fixed a few issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking with lights in the MSFS SDK is very inconvenient due to legacy APIs, the lack of good tools, and poorly-implemented light physics. They do not bounce, cast shadows or even accept geometry as a blocker. They only allow an illuminated surface to reflect other geometry. This means that lights, and how they look, need to be handcrafted within SDK limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/beacon.jpg\" alt=\"beacon\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne example of this is the beacon lights, the red ones at the top and bottom of the fuselage - we used 14 individual lights in order to cast light realistically. For the landing lights, despite only consisting of two lights in real life, we had to use 11 individual lights to create a convincing effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the strobe lights are now synced with the beacon light according to the real-life blinking pattern, whereas this was not the case before. In addition, the strobe lights are now visible from all wing views (including custom ones) and the cockpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/lights-illustration.jpg\" alt=\"lights-illustration\"\u003e\n\u003csub\u003eCopyright © 2021 Collins Aerospace, UTC Aerospace Systems\u003c/sub\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landing lights extend or retract at the correct speed, will not light up until they are fully deployed and are now independent of each other. They are also angled correctly (slightly downwards) to illuminate the runway on approach and their range has increased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNav lights now project at the correct angles and can only be seen within those angles. This is how you determine the travel direction of an airplane at night. Watch out for one red and one green at the same time, you might be in trouble!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with all these changes, the A32NX lights will continue to be improved upon when the SDK is expanded and perhaps include proper raytracing, a DX12 feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003ePreviews from the Simulator\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2TqF6kyzLM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/lights-front.jpg\" alt=\"lights-front\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/lights-wing1.jpg\" alt=\"lights-wing1\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/lights-wing2.jpg\" alt=\"lights-wing2\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/lights-window.jpg\" alt=\"lights-window\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/lights-to.jpg\" alt=\"lights-to\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/notam-images/sept/lights-logo.jpg\" alt=\"lights-logo\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA380X\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe know you are all waiting patiently on our A380X release, and while we cannot give timelines at the moment, we are very satisfied with the progress being made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are aiming to release an aircraft with entirely custom systems, with no reliance whatsoever on a default FMC.
